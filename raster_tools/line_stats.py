    features are clipped to the circular neighborhood before the length is
    computed. Optional weighting can be added with `weighting_field`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : Vector, str
        The line features to compute lengths from.
    like_rast : Raster, str
        A raster to use as a reference grid and CRS. The output raster will be

    radius : scalar
        The radius around each grid cell's center to use. Features that fall
        within the radius are clipped to the resulting circle and their
        resulting lengths are summed. Additional weighting of the sum can be
