               to quantify at scale. This study evaluates the impact of aerial
               suppression on wildfire rate of spread (ROS) using a modeling
               framework that incorporates both observed (real) and
               counterfactual (synthetic) drop locations from a sample of 62
               wildfires in Oregon. Synthetic drops were generated to simulate
               a no-suppression baseline, allowing us to compare changes in ROS
               in the presence and absence of suppression. We trained two
               random forest classifiers: one using both real and synthetic
               drops (the full model), and another using only synthetic drops
               to model baseline fire behavior. Both models used a range of
               environmental and topographic features to predict whether fire
               spread slowed following a drop. While the full model performed
               well in predicting ROS outcomes, the indicator distinguishing
               real from synthetic drops had low feature importance, suggesting
               limited causal evidence that aerial suppression efforts
               consistently reduced fire spread. The synthetic-only model
               produced similarly high predictive performance, reinforcing the
               possibility that many observed reductions in ROS may have
               occurred independent of suppression. These findings highlight
               the challenges of evaluating suppression effectiveness at scale
               and emphasize the need for improved data resolution, more
               detailed operational records, and advanced modeling techniques
               to fully understand the role of aerial fire retardant drops in
               future wildfire management activities.},
