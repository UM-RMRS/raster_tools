# Spatial Modeling Tutorials
## Overview
SpatialModelingTutorials was developed to demonstrate function modeling, batch
processing, and raster_tools functionality, along with various other coding and
modelling strategies.

This collection of Notebooks is meant to demonstrate spatial modeling
techniques that use parallel processing and the newly developed [Raster
Tools](https://github.com/UM-RMRS/raster_tools) package. Most notebooks are
designed to run within Google's Colab. However, they can also be used locally
if [Raster Tools](https://github.com/UM-RMRS/raster_tools) is properly
installed [link](./install_raster_tools.md).

To open a notebook within Colab, open a notebook and click on the “Open in
Colab” link (top left). Once in Colab you can step through each notebook cell.
